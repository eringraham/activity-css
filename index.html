    <p>This year, competition amongst airlines will result in great deals for budget travelers. Low-cost carriers such as <em>Spirit, Frontier</em> and <em>JetBlue</em> will stay competitive by offering lower base fares to popular U.S. cities including <em>New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, Las Vegas</em> and <em>Fort Lauderdale</em> — but where do travelers really want to go in 2014? From planning trips to renowned events like the FIFA World Cup, to country hopping throughout Europe and braving African safaris, here are five trips you should consider taking in the year ahead.</p>
    
    <h2>Denver</h2>
    
    <p><em>The Swiss Alps</em> are increasing in popularity, but you don’t have to travel further than the Mile High City for skiing and amazing lodge resorts. Aside from winter sports, favorites in <strong>Denver</strong> include the Green Russell, a prohibition-style speakeasy with decently-priced drinks and food, along with Red Rocks Amphitheatre located outside of the city. This area is a park with hiking and biking trails and also has an outdoor venue for concerts. The biggest draw to this area is that flights to <strong>Denver</strong> on CheapOair were consistently among the most affordable in <strong>2013</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Greece</h2>
    
    <p>The ongoing economic crisis in <em>Greece</em> leaves many opportunities to find tremendous deals on hotel and transportation costs. This year, airline growth and the launch of more non-stop services can help maximize your trip to <e,>Europe</e,> by seeing more than one country. Low-cost carriers such as London-based easyJet have direct services to Kos (KGS) in the Aegean and Herakilon (HER) in the <em>Mediterranean</em>, making it affordable to arrange travel to a U.K airport and explore <em>London</em> before heading directly to the <em>Greek islands</em>.</p>
    
    <h2>Brazil</h2>
    
    <p>Natural landscapes, historical sites and diverse cuisine make <strong>Brazil</strong> a popular destination, even without the 2014 FIFA World Cup taking place in Sao Paulo. For this reputable event, FIFA.com reported that over two million tickets were requested within the first 24 hours of ticket sales. For fans who are still interested in getting in on the action of the big game, there are many options for flying into Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport (GIG) on <strong>Brazil's</strong> major airlines including Tam and Avianca.</p>
    
    <h2>Myanmar</h2>
    
    <p>After being closed to tourism for more than 50 years, <strong>Myanmar</strong> is now welcoming travelers to visit areas that have gone unexplored for more than half a century. From large cities like Mandalay (royal palaces, art galleries, restaurants) to historical sites like Bagan which features over 10,000 of the country’s famous eleventh-century temples and pagodas, this area is extremely affordable and worthy of visiting. Also, with major hotel chains like Best Western opening in the country, you can enjoy modern amenities, while exploring ancient cultures.</p>
    
    <h2>Tanzania</h2>
    
    <p>In <em>Africa</em>, adventure-seekers will be intrigued by the country’s exotic offerings which include breathtaking summits, beaches and safaris. <em>Kilimanjaro</em>, which is the highest peak in <em>Africa</em>, is one of the world’s most magnificent sites. For those more interested in animals, Serengeti National park is a UNESCO World Heritage area, with an exceptional diversity of landscapes, culture and wildlife. <em>Zanzibar</em>, the historic and charming spice island in the <em>Indian Ocean</em>, offers visitors pristine beaches, cobbled squares and bazaars.</p>
